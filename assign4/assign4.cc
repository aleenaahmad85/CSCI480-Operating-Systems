/********************************************************************
CSCI 480 - Assignment 4 - Semester Fall 2019

Progammer: Andrew Scheel
Section:   2
TA:        Jingwan Li
Date Due:  Monday, October 14th 2019

Purpose:   In this assignment, we are simulating priority scheduling of processes
           on a single-processor system.  The idea is that when a process ends its
           CPU burst (or input burst or output burst), it is succeeded by the highest-priority
           process that is waiting.
